Mobile features the app implements:
 
	1) Accelerometer 
	2) User Input
	3) File I/O

Platform recommended:

	1) Accelerometer is only working on Android because Initially I was supposed to 
	make it for IOS but then I realised that IOS blocked some of the 
	Accelerometer features after IOS 12.1 and hence we can't access Accelerometer 
	anymore(That's what I think maybe?) 
	
	2) To get the feel of User Interface, I would recommend commenting the code for accelerometer and 
	test the UI on IOS
